# GitHub Client App

A SwiftUI-based iOS app that displays GitHub users and their repositories using the GitHub REST API.  
The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture with async/await for modern concurrency, and includes proper error handling, loading states, clean UI components, and unit tests.

* Each row must contain:
    * Profile image (avatar)
    * Username
* When a row is selected, navigate to the User Repository Screen.
  
### User Repository Screen (Details)
* Display user details at the top:
    * Profile image
    * Username
    * Full name
    * Followers count
    * Following count
* Below that, display a list of the user‚Äôs repositories (excluding forked repositories), with:
    * Repository name
    * Programming language
